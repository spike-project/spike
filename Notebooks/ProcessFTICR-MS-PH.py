# # FTICR-MS Processing and Display of Phase-Sensitive spectra
#
# ### *This is a preliminary version - use with caution*
#
# a simplified environment for processing 1D Bruker FTICR datasets with `SPIKE`
#
# Run each python cell in sequence by using the â‡¥Run button above (or typing *shift* Enter).
#
# Cells are meant to be used in order, taking you to the complete analysis, but you can go back at any time.
#
# ### Initialization of the environment
# the following cell should be run only once, at the beginning of the processing

# %%
# load all python and interactive tools - should be run only once

# ### Choose the file
# Use `FileChooser()` to choose a file on your disk - The optional `base` argument, starts the exploration on a given location.
#
# Bruker files are named `fid` and are contained in a `*.d` directory.

# %%
FC = FileChooser(filetype='fid')
display(FC)

# %% [markdown]
# (After the selection, the selected filename is found in the `FC.selected` variable)
# ### Import dataset
#

# %%
# This is simply done with the `Import_1D()` tool, which returns a `SPIKE` object.
# We store it into a variable, evaluating the variable show a summary of the dataset. 
print('Reading file ',FC.selected)

# ### First Compute Modulus Spectrum
#
# many processing methods are available, they can be either applied one by one, or piped by chaining them.
#
# Here we are chaining  apodisation - zerofill - FT - modulus
#
# then setting to `m/z` unit (`Hz` and `points` also available) - finally `display()` is used to display the dataset.
#

# %%
D1md = d1.copy() # copy the imported data-set to another object for processing
D1md.kaiser(4).zf(4).rfft().modulus() # kaiser(4) is an apodisation well adapted to FTICR, slightly more resolution than hamming(
D1md.set_unit('m/z')  # set to ppm unit - and display
I.Show1D(D1md, title=FC.selected_path)

# %% [markdown]
# # the interactive phaser.
#
# we'll apply a phase correction $\phi \propto p_o + p_1 f_w + p_2 f_w^2$ where $f_w$ is the frequency of the FTICR signal across the spectral width
#
# $p_0$ is expressed in degrees, $p_1, p_2$ are expressed in number of of full turns over the spectral width.
#
# In interactive mode, there is also a $pivot$,  it is the location where P1 and P2 are inactive.
# It is a convenience for interaction,  P0 P1 and P2 are equal to $p_o, p_1$ and $p_2$ for $pivot=0$ i.e. on the left side.
# Moving the pivot modifies the interactive values of P0 and P1, don't worry.
#
# **Recipe**
#
# - 1/ start it below - spectrum is displayed in $Hz$
#     - a very rough first guess is already in place
#     - (optionally, set the values to zero)
# - 2/ zoom on a low frequency massive (on the left of the spectrum - corresponds to high masses)  
#     - a/ the chose zoom should be quite populated on a wide enough range - use scale on the side to have it full screen
#     - b/ right click on the center - this defines the pivot location
#     - c/ use P0 to put the central line in absorption
#     - d/ use P1 to extend the absorption zone as far as possible, try to be as precise as possible
#         - if possible, try to zoom out and continue extending
#     - e/ once it's Ok, click on **"Add Entry"**
# - 3/ zoom on a high frequency massive (low masses)
#     - redo steps a/ to d/ above
#     - once you're fine, you can click on **"Add Entry"**, this will modify the value of P2 automatically
# - 4/ redo step 3/ in many different location until is seems that you have a large zone in the middle of the spectrum which is phased.
#     - if you're lost, or if P2 does not stabilises, you can always clear the list, keeping the phase correction, but restarting the P2 computation.
#     - you can always restart the cell
# - 5/ now with the whole spectrum on the zoom, 
#     - set the pivot in the center
#     - touch P0 to phase the center
#     - touch P1 to extend the phase region
#     - then slightly touch P2 to extend further the phased region
# - **Done**
