# WARNING (31th March 2023)
It seems that the various Jupyter Notebooks which use the ipympl library have a problem with the latest versions of the anaconda distribution (starting with `python 3.9`), and probably with other distribution as well.

Try the following possibilities if you have problem with the graphic and/or the interaction in the Spike Notebooks

1. the team developping jupyter is migrating the notebook to a new technology and Spike is not yet adapted to this new environment.
   In the meantime, use `nbclassic` instead of `notebook` to launch the various notebooks
    ```
    jupyter-nbclassic TheNooteBook.ipynb
    ```
2. The interaction is based on the optionnal `ipympl` extension, and some people have instabilities in the interaction
*upgrading ipympl to the 0.9.3 version seems to solve the difficulty:*
    ```
    pip install ipympl==0.9.3
    ```
or alternatively
    ```
    conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
    conda install ipympl=0.9.3
    ```
Depending on your set-up (jupyter version) it might work either in `jupyter lab`,  `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter nbclassic`, or even all of them.

# 1/ What is SPIKE ? #

**SPIKE** a collaborative development for a FT-spectroscopy processing library.

*This is the version 0.99.33 - Octobre 2023*

**SPIKE**  allows the processing, the display and the analysis of data-sets obtained from various Fourier-Transform spectroscopies. The name stands for **S**pectrometry **P**rocessing **I**nnovative **KE**rnel.

It allows the <b>processing</b> of **1D** and **2D** FT spectroscopies, mostly **NMR** and **FTICR-MS**, but also **Orbitrap**, and other to come.

It implements all needed tools for Data analysis (Fourier Transform, Baseline correction, noise reduction, peak-picking, etc...)

To our knowledge, it is the first program freely available allowing the processing, display and analysis of 2D-FT-ICR (Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance), as well as Orbitrap time domain data processing.

It is written in python3 currently developed in python 3.11  (python 2.7 has been tested up to version 0.99.10).
It is tested in python versions from 3.7 to 3.11.

It is mostly a library for processing, analysis and display of spectral data-sets.
The natural interface is either a python program or a `jupyter notebook` as an interactive front-end.


### SpI *(Spike Interactive)*
An additional program, called **SP**ike **I**nteractive (or **SpI** ) is also developed, it consists in a set of stand alone jupyter Notebooks which allow to use SPIKE process and analyse NMR and MS datasets without any programming knowledge.

It provides simple interactive environment which implement basic analysis can be found in the [SpI](Notebooks) directory.
A part of SpI is also contained in the [`Interactive`](spike/Interactive) directory in the source tree.

It is still in very active development, but also the basis for our research.

Many features are missing, and many other while present, are not fully fixed.
However, considering the amount of efforts already present in this code, we decided to make it available.
We believe that even in this current development stage, this program might prove useful for certain usages.

# 2/ Documentation
Basic presentation of functionalities can be found [Here](Presentation.md)

A complete documentation, with the full API, can be found [Here](http://softwares.casc4de.eu/spike/spikedoc/).
We try to keep it up to date, but it may lag a little behind the current program state.

Most of the documentation is in the code itself, available directly while programming (*try* `function_name?` *in* `jupyter notebook`).

Another source of documentation are [Notebooks](Notebooks) directory.
There are two type of Notebooks, fully developed ones, with interactive tools, which can be used as is,
and example Notebooks, meant for pedagogic purposes.
This is an ongoing effort, and always short of what we'd like to do.

### Release Notes
Can be found [Here](release_notes.md)


# 3/ How to get SPIKE ? ##

### simple installation
You might have python installed on your system, however, SPIKE relies on a whole set of scientific libraries which may dont be installed (see **Dependencies** below).
We advise to install a scientific python environment such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [Enthough](https://www.enthought.com/).
Then install SPIKE with the following command in the terminal:

    pip install spike-py

This will install the latest version on your machine. *(be sure to use the pip command which came with the scientific python environment)*.

If you already have SPIKE installed and want to upgrade to the last version do:

    pip install -U spike-py

### Installing from `github`
The`pip` instalation is always less recent than the github version, if you need the latest version, you simply instal it in the following way:

- Get the last version on `github`, using `git` (prefered)

        git clone https://github.com/spike-project/spike.git

- then go to the spike directory and type the following command (new syntax due to changes in development team)

        pip install -e

This method allows you to update your `Spike` distibution from `github` and always use the latest version by doing

        git pull; git update

in your spike directory.

Alternatively, you can simply download the archive

        wget https://github.com/spike-project/spike/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
        unzip master.zip
	cd spike
        pip install -e
        
### Installing additional tools
Several additional tools may be of interest.

**a/ Interactive jupyter notebooks from SpI**
can be found in the [Notebooks](Notebooks) directory or on [github](https://github.com/spike-project/spike/tree/master/Notebooks). 
You will find there fully developed interactive notebooks allowing data analysis without any knowledge in python programming, as well as examples to starting writing small pyhton programs for specific needs.

First the tool `ipympl` needs to be installed (it may not be installed along the scientific environment)
To install it, simply do (check warning above):

    pip install ipympl

Then copy the related NotBooks to a directory by typing in a terminal in this directory.

    python -m spike.installSpI

this will copy all the tools, you can safely remove the unneeded one, as the same command will always bring you all the notebooks.


**b/ additional plugins** are available in the [plugins/special](spike/plugins/special) directory in the source tree. [check on github](https://github.com/spike-project/spike/tree/master/spike/plugins/specials).

If you want to use them, create a directory called `Spike` in your HOME directory, and a directory called `plugins` in this one (hence `$HOME/Spike/plugins`), and put then there, they will be directly activated. 
You can also develop your own plugins and put them here.

Note that some plugins or extension require additional libraries (`ipympl`, `MPI`, `bokeh`, `mayavi`, ...)

### Licenses
The Spike program is distributed under the [`CeCILL 2.1 FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT`](http://www.cecill.info)

- [progressbar](https://github.com/niltonvolpato/python-progressbar) N.Volpato - under LGPL licence

### source and dependencies

# 6/ Origin of the program

**SPIKE** is originated from the _Gifa_ program, developed by M-A Delsuc and others in `FORTRAN 77` since the late eighties, it still shares similarities, such as command names, or internal data organisation.

_Gifa_ was abandoned around 2005, but it actually experienced a revival in 2020 thanks to the " *ten years challenge* " organised by the [ReScience C Journal](https://rescience.github.io/read/). You can find an installable and runnable version here: https://github.com/delsuc/Gifa

_Gifa_ has known several mutations, and finally ended as a partial rewrite called **NPK**.
The [NPK](http://abcis.cbs.cnrs.fr/NPK/) program is based on some of the original `FORTRAN` code, wrapped in Java and Python, which allows to control all the program possibilities from the Python level.
NPK is purely a computing kernel, with no graphical possibilities, and has been used as a kernel embedded in the commercial program NMRNoteBook, commercialized by NMRTEC.

However, NPK was showing many weaknesses, mostly due to the 32bits organization, and a poor file format. So, when a strong scientific environment became available in Python, a rewrite in pure Python was undertaken. To this initial project, called NPK-V2, many new functionalities were added, and mostly the capability to work in other spectroscopies than NMR.

At some point in 2014, we chose to fork NPK-V2 to SPIKE, and made it public.
