# # Spike Notebook
#
# a simplified environment for processing 1D Bruker FTICR datasets with `SPIKE`
#
# # FTICR-MS Processing and Display
#
# ***Usage***
#
# - Run each python cell in sequence by using the â‡¥Run button above (or typing *shift* Enter).
# - Cells are meant to be used in order, taking you to the complete analysis, but you can go back at any time.
# - The SPIKE code used for processing is visible in the cells, and can be used as a minimal tutorial.
# - You can hide it when done to present a clean NoteBook.
#
# ***Remark*** *to use this program, you should have installed the following packages:*
#
# - *a complete scientific python environment ( tested with python 3.9 / [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)  with no support for python 2.7 )*
# - [`spike`](https://www.bitbucket.org/delsuc/spike) ( *version 0.99.32 minimum* )
# - [`ipywidgets`](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  ( *tested with version 7.6* )
# - [`ipympl`](https://github.com/matplotlib/jupyter-matplotlib)  ( *adds interactivity in the notebook* )
# - mass analysis requires [`isotope`](https://github.com/delsuc/isotope) and fine isotopic requires [Neutronstar](https://bitbucket.org/orserang/neutronstar.git)
#
# ## Initialization
# the following cell is to be run once, at the beginning of the processing
#

# ### Initialization of the environment
# the following cell should be run only once, at the beginning of the processing

# %%
# load all python and interactive tools - has to be run only once (but it does not hurt to rerun...)

# ### Choose the file
# The `FileChooser()` tool creates a dialog box which allows to choose a file on your disk
#
# - use the `Select` button, click on the directory to move around `..` is for going back in the directory tree
# - click on the file to select it
# - modify the ( *optional* ) `path` argument, to start the exploration on a given location
# - changing to `path='.'` will start the browsing from the current directory 
# - After the selection, the selected filename is found in `FC.selected`
#
# Bruker files are named `fid` and are contained in a `*.d` directory.

# %%
FC = FileChooser(path='/DATA', filetype='fid')
display(FC)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Import dataset and display FID
#
# This is simply done with the `Import_1D()` tool, which returns a `SPIKE` object.
#
# We store the dataset into a variable, here called d1. 

# %%
print('Reading file ',FC.selected)
d1 = BrukerMS.Import_1D(FC.selected)           # Import_1D creates a SPIKE FTICRData object, from which everything is available
d1.set_unit('sec')                             # it can be acted upon
d1.filename = FC.selected                      # and be extended at will
print(d1)                                      # print() of the dataset shows a summary of the parameters

I.Show1D(d1, title=FC.selected, yratio=1)      # and display  (yratio=1 to have it centered)
# alternatively you can use the low-level tool below:
# d1.display()  # with many options, plus access to matplotlib details

# %% [markdown]
# Spectra can be interactively explored with the jupyter tools displayed  on the side of the dataset:
#
# - zoom with <button class="jupyter-matplotlib-button jupyter-widgets jupyter-button" href="#" title="Zoom to rectangle" style="outline: currentcolor none medium;"><i class="center fa fa-square-o"></i></button>
# - shift and resize
# <button class="jupyter-matplotlib-button jupyter-widgets jupyter-button" href="#" title="Pan axes with left mouse, zoom with right" style="outline: currentcolor none medium;"><i class="center fa fa-arrows"></i></button>
#  (with left and right click)
# - <button class="jupyter-matplotlib-button jupyter-widgets jupyter-button" href="#" title="Back to previous view" style="outline: currentcolor none medium;"><i class="center fa fa-arrow-left"></i></button>
# and
# <button class="jupyter-matplotlib-button jupyter-widgets jupyter-button" href="#" title="Forward to next view" style="outline: currentcolor none medium;"><i class="center fa fa-arrow-right"></i></button>
# allow to navigate in the zoom history
#
# - <button class="jupyter-matplotlib-button jupyter-widgets jupyter-button" href="#" title="Download plot" style="outline: currentcolor none medium;"><i class="center fa fa-fw fa-floppy-o"></i></button> is used to store a `png` graphic file of the current display.

#
# ## Basic Processing
# The following cell applies a basic processing, check the documentation for more advanced processing
#
# ### Compute Spectrum
#
# many processing methods are available, they can be either applied one by one, or piped by chaining them.
#
# Here we are chaining  apodisation - zerofill - FT - modulus
#
# then setting to `m/z` unit (`Hz` and `points` also available) - finally `display()` is used to display the dataset.
#

# %%
D1 = d1.copy()                               # copy the imported data-set to another object for processing
D1.center().kaiser(4).zf(4)   # chaining  centering - apodisation - zerofill
                              # kaiser(4) is an apodisation well adapted to FTICR, slightly more resolution than hamming - try varying the argument !
if D1.axis1.itype == 0:       # means data is real (common case)
    D1.rfft().modulus()           # chaining  real FT - modulus
else:                         #       data is complex, in Narrow-band acquisition
    D1.fft().modulus()            # chaining  complex FT - modulus
D1.bcorr(xpoints=50)          # flatten the baseline
D1.set_unit('m/z')

FI.Show1D(D1, title=FC.nmrname)  #  and display

# D1.display(title=FC.selected_path)  #  alternative, lower level display method with more options


# %% [markdown]
# ### Peak Detection
# The following is used to perform an interactive peak picking, and output the result
# Use the cursor to choose the sensitivity of the picker.

# %%
pkname = op.join(op.dirname(FC.selected),"peak_list.txt")
import spike.plugins.Peaks
print("number of on-screen peaks is limited to %d - zoom in with the top tool to be sure of visualizing them all"%(FI.NbMaxDisplayPeaks))
P = FI.MSPeaker(D1, pkname)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Superpose experimental and computed spectra
# *The MS-Isotopic module must have been installed - see first cell for information*
#
# If the spectrum requires recalibration - eventually run the Calibration tool below, and rerun this tool.

# %% slideshow={"slide_type": "fragment"}
try:
    IS = ISO.Isotope()
    Full = IS.full(D1)
except NameError:
    print("MSIsotopic not installed - see top of the page")   # error message if additional software not installed
Full

# %% [markdown]
# ---
# ### Calibration and reference peaks
#
# The calibration used by SPIKE is based on a 2 or 3 parameters equation :
# $$
# f = \frac{A}{m/z} - B + \frac{C}{(m/z)^2}
# $$
# You can change them below.
#
# For the moment you can recalibrate on a single reference peak, 
# this modifies the first order $A$ parameter only.
#

# %%
reload(FI)
FI.Calib(D1);

# %% [markdown]
# ### Save processed data
# You can save a dataset, two formats are available:
#
# - Native SPIKE format, `*.msh5` where all informations are stored - run the following cell

# %%
msh5name = op.join(op.dirname(FC.selected),"SpikeProcessed.msh5")
D1.save_msh5(msh5name, compressed=True)
print("File is stored as %s"%msh5name)

# %% [markdown]
# - Or `cvs` format, with only the spectrum (for the peak list, see above) - ( *be carefull this file can be very big*)

# %%
csvname = op.join(op.dirname(FC.selected),"SpikeProcessed.csv")
D1.save_csv(csvname)
print("File is stored as %s"%csvname)

# %% [markdown]
# ### superimpose spectra
# you can superimpose several spectra stored as `.msh5` files in order to compare them

# %%
reload(FI)
from IPython.display import display
SP = FI.SuperImpose(base='/DATA',N=3).Show()

# %% [markdown]
# *the following cell display the colormap used here*

# %%
